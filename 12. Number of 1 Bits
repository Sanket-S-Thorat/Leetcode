#Why bitwise and the n with (n-1):
#Say n = 10 --> 1010
#n-1 = 9 --> 1001
#n-2 = 8 --> 1000
#n-3 = 7 --> 0111
#So, we see a pattern here that binary of 'n-1' is having all digits inverted from the least significant 1 in binary of 'n'. So, if we recursively and n with n-1 it would atmost lead to all 1 in n-1.

class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while n > 0:
            count+=1
            n = n & (n-1)
        return count
